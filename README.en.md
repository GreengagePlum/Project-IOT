Here is [a programming project](https://github.com/GreengagePlum/Project-IOT) in **Arduino C** and **Python** that aims to create and monitor an network of IOT sensors. The subject paper for the project is [available here](./IOC_mode_projet%20–%20SESI.pdf) for more details.

This project uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) framework on the web server side.

## Authors

This programming project was carried out for the IOC (IOT) class of the Computer Science Master's first year, second semester (M1S2 2024/25) at Sorbonne Université by the following two fellow gentlemen.

* Efe ERKEN 21400542
* Sylvain PRANDO 2xxxxxxx

## Language versions

### C

The Arduino variant of C is used along with the Arduino IDE (**v2.3.4**) as the compiler. The ESP32 library used along with the Arduino IDE is `esp32` by Espressif (**v1.0.6**).

As one of us is working on a Mac computer (macOS **Sequoia 15.3.2**), the additional drivers required and their versions are as follows:

* CP210xVCPDriver (**v6.0.2**)
* CH34xVCPDriver (**v1.9**)

### Python

Right below are the different versions of Python we used for the web server:

Python 3.11.3
